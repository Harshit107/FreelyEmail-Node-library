# FreelyEmail (API)

FreelyEmail API Library is a RESTful web service that provides developers with an easy-to-use interface for sending emails from within their applications. It allows developers to send emails quickly and easily without having to set up their own SMTP server or domain.

To use the API, a developer needs to call method with required data for sending the email, such as the recipient's email address, subject, and message body. The API then takes care of the rest, including formatting and sending the email using the DoNot-Reply.online domain.

One of the main benefit of this FreelyEmail API is that it simplifies the process of sending emails for developers who may not have the time or resources to set up their own email infrastructure. It also provides an added layer of security, as it allows developers to send emails without disclosing their own domain or email server information.

Summary (ðŸ˜‚):

It also come with Android and Node Js library which reduces the effort of managing APIs and handling errors.
